# Lifestyle Layer — Webflow Page Copy & Structure

**URL:** clearformcreative.com/services/lifestyle-layer

**Design Notes:** Follow existing Clearform page patterns — black/white with minimal accent color, Montserrat/Inter/Roboto Mono typography, generous whitespace, rounded pill-shaped CTAs, full-width hero. Match the layout rhythm of your /services/photography page but with the gallery-forward approach of The View Pro.

---

## Section 1: Hero

**Layout:** Full-width hero image (before/after slider or lifestyle-layered hero shot). Text overlaid or beside it.

### Headline:
```
Bring Your Property to Life.
```

### Subheading:
```
AI-enhanced lifestyle imagery that shows what living here actually feels like.
No models. No stock photos. Just your property — with people in it.
```

### CTA Buttons:
- **Primary:** "See Examples" (scrolls to gallery)
- **Secondary:** "Get Started" (scrolls to contact/pricing)

---

## Section 2: The Problem (2-column: text left, image right)

**Layout:** Text block on left, striking before/after comparison on right.

### Heading:
```
Empty Rooms Don't Sell.
```

### Body:
```
Buyers scroll past empty spaces. Renters can't picture themselves in a vacant unit.
Stock photos feel generic. And a full lifestyle photo shoot with models, hair, makeup,
and permits costs thousands and takes weeks.

Lifestyle Layer fills the gap — photorealistic lifestyle imagery generated from
your existing property photos, delivered in 48 hours.
```

---

## Section 3: How It Works (3-step process)

**Layout:** Three columns with numbered steps, icon or image above each. Match your photography page's process section style.

### Heading:
```
How It Works
```

### Step 1:
**Icon/Image:** Camera or photo icon
```
You Shoot It
```
```
Capture your property the way you normally would — or use photos from
a previous Clearform shoot. High-res, well-lit spaces work best.
```

### Step 2:
**Icon/Image:** Grid/palette icon
```
Pick Your Scenes
```
```
Choose from our template library — morning coffee, pool day, family
dinner, work from home, and more. We match the lifestyle to the property
and audience.
```

### Step 3:
**Icon/Image:** Sparkle/delivery icon
```
Get Your Images
```
```
We deliver photorealistic lifestyle images in landscape, square, and
vertical formats — ready for social, web, leasing decks, and print.
48-hour turnaround. One round of revisions included.
```

---

## Section 4: Template Library / Gallery

**Layout:** Filterable grid gallery (tabs or filter buttons across the top). Each image is clickable to lightbox. Show before/after where possible.

### Heading:
```
Scene Library
```

### Subheading:
```
Every property tells a different story. Pick the scenes that match your audience.
```

### Filter Tabs:

## Section 8: FAQ

**Layout:** Expandable accordion. Match your existing FAQ styling.

### Heading:
```
Questions
```

**Q: How realistic are the images?**
```
Very. We use state-of-the-art AI models with human quality review on
every image. The people, lighting, and shadows are matched to your
original photo. See our gallery for examples.
```

**Q: Are these AI-generated?**
```
Yes. Lifestyle Layer uses AI to add photorealistic lifestyle elements to
your existing property photos. We always provide the original unaltered
photos alongside your enhanced images, and include appropriate disclosure
per industry and state regulations.
```

**Q: What about Fair Housing and diversity?**
```
Every image set includes diverse representation across age, gender, and
background. We built inclusive representation into our process from day
one — it's not an afterthought. We never deliver a set that shows only
one demographic.
```

**Q: What photos work best?**
```
High-resolution, well-lit photos of empty or minimally staged spaces.
Photos from your Clearform shoot work perfectly. We can also work with
photos from other photographers — just make sure they're high-res.
```

**Q: Do I own the images?**
```
Yes. You receive full usage rights for all delivered images. Use them
on your website, social media, leasing materials, print ads — anywhere.
```

**Q: How do revisions work?**
```
Every order includes one round of revisions. You can request changes to
the people, poses, demographics, or scene style. We'll regenerate and
deliver updated images within 48 hours.
```

**Q: Can I add this to an existing Clearform shoot?**
```
Absolutely. Lifestyle Layer works best with photos from your Clearform
shoot. Just let us know when you book or after delivery, and we'll handle
the rest.
```

## Section 9: CTA

**Layout:** Full-width section with dark background (black). Two-column with text left and CTA buttons right. Match your photography page's bottom CTA section.

Or send us photos from a past project. Either way, we'll bring your
property to life.
```

### CTA Buttons:
- **Primary:** "Get My Quote" (links to contact form or /contact-us)
- **Secondary:** "Schedule a Call" (links to your calendar)

---

## Section 10: Disclosure Footer (small text)

**Layout:** Small, subtle text below the CTA or in the page footer area.

```
All Lifestyle Layer images are AI-enhanced. Original unaltered photographs
are retained and available upon request. Imagery is created with inclusive
representation aligned with Fair Housing guidelines. Equal Housing Opportunity.
```

Include the EHO logo (small, tasteful).
