# Lifestyle Layer — Legal & Compliance Guide

---

## 1. Fair Housing Act (Federal)

### What It Says
The Fair Housing Act prohibits advertising that indicates preference, limitation, or discrimination based on:
- Race / Color
- Religion
- Sex (including gender identity and sexual orientation)
- Familial status (families with children, pregnant women)
- National origin
- Disability

### What This Means for Lifestyle Layer
- **Never deliver an image set that only shows one demographic.** If all 5 images in a pack show young white couples, that could be interpreted as discriminatory advertising — even if unintentional.
- **Every delivery must include visible diversity** across race, age, gender, and family structure.
- **Never use prompts that exclude protected classes.** Don't prompt "no children" or "young professionals only" as a way to target demographics — the AI-generated images should reflect an inclusive community.
- **Include the EHO logo** on your Lifestyle Layer service page and marketing materials.

### Your Compliance Rule
For any delivery of 5+ images: minimum 3 different demographic representations visible across the set. For 10+: minimum 5.

## 2. California AI Disclosure Law (AB 1886 — Effective January 1, 2026)

### What It Says
Licensed real estate brokers and salespersons in California must:
- **Disclose when images used in advertising/promotional materials have been digitally altered**
- **Provide access to the original, unaltered images**

### What This Means for Lifestyle Layer
Since your clients are the ones using these in their listings/marketing, YOU need to make it easy for THEM to comply.

### Your Compliance Actions:
1. **Always deliver the original unaltered photo alongside every lifestyle-layered image**
2. **Include a disclosure label** on or with every delivered image
3. **Provide your clients with ready-to-use disclosure language** they can add to their listings

### Recommended Disclosure Language (For Client Use):
```
This image has been digitally enhanced with AI-generated lifestyle
elements. The original unaltered photograph is available upon request.
```

### Shorter Version (For Social Media):
```
AI-enhanced lifestyle imagery. Original photo available upon request.
```

## 3. NAR (National Association of Realtors) Guidelines

### What's Relevant
- NAR requires all REALTORS to complete 2 hours of Fair Housing training every 3 years (effective Jan 2025)
- MLS listings increasingly require disclosure of AI-altered images
- NAR has signaled that AI-generated content in listings needs clear labeling

### What This Means for You
Your clients (agents/brokers) need to be confident that using Lifestyle Layer won't put them in compliance trouble. Make it easy for them.

**Original Photos:**
Clearform Creative retains copies of all original, unaltered photographs and will make them available upon request.

**Fair Housing Compliance:**
Lifestyle Layer images are created with diverse demographic representation. Clearform Creative does not create images intended to express preference for or against any protected class under the Fair Housing Act.

**Limitation of Liability:**

## 8. States to Watch (AI Disclosure in Real Estate)

California is the first, but more states are likely to follow. Keep an eye on:
- **New York** — often follows California on consumer protection
- **Illinois** — has aggressive AI/biometric laws already
- **Colorado** — AI Act already in effect for high-risk AI systems
- **Texas** — growing real estate market with increasing regulation

For now, California compliance covers the highest standard. If you're compliant there, you're likely compliant everywhere.
