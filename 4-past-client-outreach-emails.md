# Lifestyle Layer — Past Client Outreach Emails

These go to past clients BEFORE the public launch. You're giving them free samples, collecting feedback, and seeding LinkedIn engagement for launch day.

## Email 1: The Free Sample (Send March 15-20)

**Subject:** Made something for you with your [Property Name] photos

---

Hi [First Name],

I've been working on something new and wanted you to be one of the first to see it.

I took a few photos from your [Property Name] shoot and created these:

[Insert 2-3 lifestyle-layered images from THEIR property — no before/after needed here, just the final lifestyle images looking their best]

We're calling it **Lifestyle Layer** — photorealistic lifestyle imagery generated from your actual property photos. No models, no shoot, no stock.

These are yours to use however you'd like — on me.

I'm planning to launch this officially in April and I'd genuinely love your honest take:

- Would you use something like this in your marketing?
- Which images feel the most natural/useful?
- Anything that looks off or could be better?

Just reply here — even a one-liner helps.

Thanks for being one of the first to see this,
Roy

## Email 2: The LinkedIn Ask (Send March 25-31, After They Respond)

Only send this to clients who responded positively to Email 1.

**Subject:** Quick favor — 30 seconds

---

Hey [First Name],

Thanks for the feedback on the Lifestyle Layer images — really glad they landed well.

I'm launching this officially on [LinkedIn post date] with a post showing some before/after examples (including a few from [Property Name], if that's OK with you).

Would you mind dropping a comment or a like when you see it? It would mean a lot to have some real voices in the thread — not just crickets on launch day.

I'll send you the link the morning it goes live so you don't have to hunt for it.

Thanks,
Roy

## Email 3: The LinkedIn Nudge (Send Morning of Launch Day)

**Subject:** It's live — here's the link

---

Hey [First Name],

The Lifestyle Layer post just went live on LinkedIn:

[Direct link to LinkedIn post]

If you've got 10 seconds, a like or comment would be huge. Even something simple like "These look great" or "We used these for [Property Name] and loved them" goes a long way.

Thanks for the support,
Roy

## Suggested Talking Points for Clients Who Want to Comment

Give these to clients who ask "what should I say?" — keep it natural:

- "We used this for [Property Name] and the leasing team loved having lifestyle content without booking a model shoot."
- "These look incredibly natural. Hard to believe it's AI."
- "This is a game-changer for multifamily marketing."
- "We've been looking for something like this — the diversity and quality is impressive."
- "Roy did a test run on one of our properties and the results were honestly better than we expected."

## Who to Send These To (Priority List)

### Tier 1 — Best Relationships (Send to First)
Clients you've worked with multiple times who are responsive and would give honest feedback. They're also the most likely to engage on LinkedIn.

### Tier 2 — Recent Clients
Anyone you've shot for in the last 6 months. The photos are still relevant to their marketing.

### Tier 3 — Big Names
If any Blackstone, Greystar, Marriott, or similar contacts would engage, that social proof is gold. Even a like from a recognizable brand name boosts credibility.

### Target: 10-15 Past Clients
Aim to send Email 1 to 10-15 past clients. If even 5-7 engage on LinkedIn, you'll have a strong launch thread.
