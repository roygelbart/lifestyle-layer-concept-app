# Lifestyle Layer — Go-To-Market Gameplan (Multifamily + Agents)

## Objective
Position Lifestyle Layer as a premium visual add-on that increases listing appeal and lease-up performance without requiring another shoot.

## Core Audience
1. Multifamily marketing teams (regional + property marketing)
2. Real estate agents/brokers listing multifamily + high-end residential

## Positioning
**Primary promise:**
Add lifestyle and emotional context to existing assets fast.

**Value message:**
- Faster than another shoot
- Lower operational burden than casting/production
- More marketable visuals for web, paid, social, and listing pages

## Funnel Structure
1. **Landing page** (examples + offer + CTA)
2. **Form intake** (asset count, property type, timeline, goal)
3. **Call booking** (qualification + scope)
4. **Pilot batch** (3–8 images)
5. **Expansion** (portfolio-level package)

## Page Requirements (MVP)
- Hero promise + dual CTA (Book Call, Submit Form)
- Before/after gallery with filters
- “How it works” 3-step block
- Pricing anchor (starts at $200/image)
- FAQ + required AI disclaimer
- Sticky CTA on mobile

## Form Fields (short)
- Name
- Company
- Email
- Property type (multifamily / agent listing / other)
- Number of images needed
- Preferred turnaround
- Link/upload to sample photos
- Goal (lease-up / listing engagement / social ads / other)

## Sales Motion
- Start with one pilot image set
- Show side-by-side improvement
- Upsell to batch package by property/portfolio

## Packaging (speed to close)
- **Pilot Pack:** 3 images
- **Campaign Pack:** 10 images
- **Portfolio Pack:** 25+ images (custom)

## Proof Strategy
- Build category-specific example banks:
  - Unit interiors
  - Amenities
  - Exterior lifestyle context
- Tag examples by property class (A/B/C) and market type

## Metrics to Track
- Landing page conversion rate (bookings + forms)
- Form completion rate
- Call-to-close rate
- Pilot-to-expansion rate
- Average images per client

## 7-Day Build Plan
Day 1: finalize messaging + wireframe
Day 2: build landing page sections and CTA flow
Day 3: import gallery examples + filters
Day 4: connect form + booking
Day 5: QA copy, mobile UX, load speed
Day 6: run 3-5 internal test leads through flow
Day 7: launch + iterate from first calls

## Notes
- Keep language outcome-focused, not technical.
- Multifamily-first examples should be visible above the fold.
- Include this disclaimer wherever relevant:
