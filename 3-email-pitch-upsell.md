## Option A: Bundled With Delivery

**Subject:** Your [Property Name] photos are ready — plus something new

---

Hi [First Name],

Your [Property Name] photos are ready — [link to gallery/download].

While editing, I kept thinking about how these spaces would look with people actually living in them. Not stock photos — real, natural lifestyle moments generated from your specific property.

We just launched **Lifestyle Layer** — and I'd love to show you what it can do with your photos.

**Here's a free sample I made from your shoot:**

- Multiple scene types — morning coffee, poolside, work from home, families, and more
- Three format sizes per image (social, web, and print ready)
- Diverse representation built in (Fair Housing aligned)
- 48-hour turnaround

**Pricing:**
- 1 image — $200
- 5 images — $850
- 10 images — $1,500

Want to see more? Reply to this email or [book a 10-minute call] and I'll walk you through the full scene library.

## Option B: Standalone Follow-Up (Sent 3-5 Days After Delivery)

**Subject:** What if [Property Name] had people in it?

Hi [First Name],

Quick follow-up — hope the [Property Name] photos are working well for your team.

I wanted to show you something I've been working on. I took one of your property photos and added a lifestyle element to it:

[Insert before/after comparison]

It's called **Lifestyle Layer** — AI-enhanced imagery that places photorealistic people into your property photos. Think of it as the step between "nice empty room" and "I want to live there."

A few clients have started using these for:
- Social media posts (they outperform empty room shots consistently)
- Leasing decks and presentations
- Website hero images
- Email marketing campaigns

The images include diverse representation across every set — built to align with Fair Housing.

If you're interested, I can create a full set from your existing [Property Name] photos. Starts at $200 per image, or $850 for a 5-pack.

Just reply here and I'll send over the scene options.
